# ------------ notes from bas ------------
# Data above 0x9000 is hands off for the application
# Not known what exactely resides over there.
# Partitiontable and bootloader are for example at 0x8000 and 0x1000 respectively.

# App partitions have to be 64K aligned and are recommended to start at 0x10000.
# Data partiotions have to be 4K aligned.
